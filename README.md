# -Packet-Tracer-Lab-Implement-Basic-Connectivity-Basic-Switch-Configuration-
This lab focuses on basic Layer 2 switch configuration and network connectivity using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal is to configure switch management interfaces (SVIs), assign IP addresses to end devices, and verify connectivity using common IOS show and ping commands.

🎯 Objectives
Perform basic configuration on Cisco switches (S1 and S2)
Configure switch management interfaces using SVI (VLAN 1)
Assign IP addresses to PCs
Verify end-to-end network connectivity
